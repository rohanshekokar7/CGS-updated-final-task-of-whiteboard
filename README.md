That's it! You can start using the whiteboard immediately.

Testing Methods To ensure all features are working correctly, you can perform the following manual tests:

Drawing and Tools Pencil/Ink Pen: Select each tool. Draw on the canvas. The pencil should have soft, round edges, while the ink pen should have sharp, flat edges. The cursor should change to match the tool.
Eraser: Draw something, then select the eraser. The eraser should remove parts of the drawing on the active layer only. It should work correctly in both light and dark modes.

Shapes: Select the rectangle, circle, and line tools. Click and drag on the canvas to draw each shape. Verify that a live preview is shown and the final shape appears on mouse release.

Stroke and Color Customization Color: Click the color picker, select a new color, and draw. The new stroke should use the selected color. The stroke preview dot should also update.
Size: Drag the size slider. The stroke preview dot should change size in real-time. Draw on the canvas to confirm the stroke thickness has changed.

Data Persistence Draw several strokes on a layer.
Refresh the browser page.

Expected Result: The drawing, active board, and active layer should be fully restored.

Board and Layer Management Boards:
Click the + button next to the board dropdown to create a new board and give it a name.

Draw something different on the new board.

Use the board dropdown to switch back to the first board. The original content should reappear.

Click the Delete button to remove a board (note: you cannot delete the last remaining board).

Layers:

Click the + button next to the layer dropdown to add a new layer.

Draw something on the new layer.

Switch between layers using the dropdown. The canvas should only show the content of visible layers, and drawing actions should only affect the currently active layer.

Click the "eye" icon to toggle the visibility of the active layer. The content should hide/show accordingly.

Undo/Redo On a single layer, draw 3-4 separate lines.
Press the Undo button (or Ctrl/Cmd+Z) three times. Each line should disappear one by one.

Press the Redo button (or Ctrl/Cmd+Y) three times. Each line should reappear one by one.

Switch to a different layer and confirm that its undo/redo history is separate.

Theme and Responsiveness Dark/Light Mode: Click the theme toggle button. The entire UI, including the canvas background, should smoothly transition between themes.
Mobile View: Open your browser's developer tools and switch to a mobile device view (e.g., iPhone 12).

Expected Result: The toolbar should become a single, horizontally scrollable row. The layout should be clean and usable, with no visual bugs.

Export Functionality Create a drawing with content on multiple visible layers.
Click the "Export" button.

Expected Result: A high-quality PNG file should be downloaded. The image should contain a composite of all visible layers on the correct background color (light or dark).
